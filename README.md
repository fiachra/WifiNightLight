## Synopsis

This is the software for a night light / childs alarm clock using as strip of WS2812s and an ESP8266 (specifically an ESP01). 

## Basic Function

Clock is a specific colour during the daytime and a specific colour at night. Gives more than enough light to keep scary monsters away. Also helps a 2+ year old to know it's still night time when he wakes in the middle of the night and Daddy doesn't need to get up and play (although sometimes he still does, it's a clock not a miracle).
